## TL;DR: My 2025 Mental Health Recap

- [**2024 Burnout**](#2024-the-burnout-year): Revenue record as freelancer, but exhaustion from overwork and client demands led to isolation and workaholism.
- [**2025 Near-Quit**](#early-2025-the-near-quit): Almost gave up for a stable job, but a failed interview sparked realization—entrepreneurship is my calling.
- [**Building Ventures**](#the-revelation-building-my-own-path): Launched SupaCodeur, Telegram Finder, and agency, but mental toll included anxiety, imposter syndrome, and isolation.
- [**Finding Balance**](#finding-balance-in-the-chaos): Travel, Japanese learning, social sharing, reframing failures, and open source contributions kept me grounded.
- [**Key Lesson**](#to-anyone-feeling-this): Entrepreneurship tests mental health relentlessly, but prioritizing sanity leads to resilience and joy.

## 2024: The Burnout Year

Let's start with 2024, because that's where the cracks began to show.

I hit my **all-time revenue record** as a freelancer. Numbers were up, projects were flowing. But beneath the surface, I was drowning.

I was underwater—too many projects, too little time. Most of my clients were entrepreneurs or pseudo-entrepreneurs: amazing people with big dreams but tight budgets. That meant endless communication, building everything from scratch, managing expectations. I loved the creative challenge, but it was exhausting.

The workaholic in me thrived on it. I'd work 12-16 hour days, weekends included. No boundaries. My personal life? Non-existent. Relationships suffered. I was irritable, isolated, and running on fumes.

But I found escape through travel. Those moments away forced me to listen to myself. To breathe. To realize I needed to care for *me*, not just my clients.

That's when [SupaCodeur](/blog/how-supacodeur-got-its-first-users-from-internal-tool-to-niche-saas) was born in my mind—a tool to automate my freelance prospecting. A way to regain control, but no time to build it yet.

## Early 2025: The Near-Quit

January 2025 hit like a freight train. I was done. Burned out from the freelance grind, I wanted out.

"I need a job," I told myself. "A stable paycheck. Hobbies. A life."

I applied everywhere. Passed interviews. Almost landed a dream gig: full remote, great pay, solid Web3 company.

Then came June. A completely failed interview. Sitting there, I had an epiphany: *What if I end up in this company? Being miserable, not doing what I love?*

That moment changed everything. I realized entrepreneurship was always a part of me. I couldn't give it up, no matter how hard it got. This is part of the journey, every entrepreneur faces it.

## The Revelation: Building My Own Path

Despite the mental load, 2025 brought unexpected luck.

[SupaCodeur](/blog/how-supacodeur-got-its-first-users-from-internal-tool-to-niche-saas) became real. I turned that internal tool into a SaaS, landed my first users, built an agency to handle services without going solo. No dream company wanted to hire me? Fine—I'll create my own.

[Telegram Finder](/blog/telegram-finder-seo-case-study-1000-plus-users-zero-ads) exploded unexpectedly. Suddenly, I was juggling three businesses.

But the mental toll was real. Anxiety attacks over MRR targets. Isolation—days alone, no friends left. Imposter syndrome screaming: *Who am I to do this?*

I started sharing on [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/vachmara), chasing revenue sharing (still not eligible, but worth it). [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@agence_swai) and [YouTube Shorts](https://www.youtube.com/@agence_swai) followed—documenting the journey, the bad days and good. Raw, real, human.

## The Struggle is Real

Running three businesses? It's chaos. I'm struggling—financially, emotionally. Almost no social life. But every morning, I wake up loving it.

That's the paradox of entrepreneurship. It takes everything, but gives you purpose.

The anxiety? Still there. The burnout? Lingers. But now I manage it.

## Finding Balance in the Chaos

Here's what saved me:

### 1. Travel and Self-Care

Travel became my lifeline. Getting away, listening to my body, remembering I'm human. Even if I slow down in 2025 because I really abused it in 2024.

### 2. Learning Something New

I dove into learning Japanese on Duolingo—100 days straight and counting. Mastering a new kanji or nailing a conversation gives me that dopamine hit of achievement, reminding me that growth happens outside work too. It's become my mental reset button.

### 3. Community and Sharing

Social media became my outlet. Sharing struggles normalized them, and DMs from fellow entrepreneurs often turned into real connections. Connecting with others reminded me I'm not alone in this wild ride.

### 4. Reframing the Journey

Every failure is data. Every struggle, growth. I stopped comparing to others' highlights and started building my own path, at my own pace, with my own definitions of success.

### 5. Open Source and Giving Back
Contributing to open source reminded me of why I love building. Giving back fueled my passion and reignited my creativity. (See how you can earn money thanks to open source [here](/blog/how-you-can-earn-money-thanks-to-open-source))

These aren't quick fixes, but they've kept me grounded amid the chaos.

## Where I Am Now

2025 was brutal but transformative. I'm building businesses I love, sharing authentically, and growing.

But with three ventures running simultaneously, it's overwhelming. That's one reason I'm considering selling [SupaCodeur](/blog/how-supacodeur-got-its-first-users-from-internal-tool-to-niche-saas) or finding a co-founder to help manage it. If you're interested in acquiring it, check out my [TrustMrr profile](https://trustmrr.com/founder/vachmara).

The mental health battle continues. Entrepreneurship tests you relentlessly. But it also teaches resilience, empathy, and joy in creation.

## To Anyone Feeling This

If you're drowning in the entrepreneurial grind: You're not alone. The burnout, the doubt, the isolation—they're universal.

But you can survive. Thrive, even.

Take care of your mind like your business. Because without sanity, success means nothing.

Remember: The struggle is part of the story. And your story is worth telling.

## Looking Ahead

2026 feels hopeful. More businesses, more sharing, more balance.

Entrepreneurship nearly broke me in 2024-2025. But it also rebuilt me stronger.

Here's to the journey—messy, beautiful, ours.
