## The origin story

In **April 2024**, I was burned out from scrolling through low-quality leads on Codeur.com. Like many freelancers, I found most projects on the platform were either:

- Underfunded
- Vague or unserious
- Ghosted you mid-discussion

But I kept using Codeur anyway, because despite the mess, it still brought me clients.

So I built myself a tool.  
Not a startup. Not a product. Just an **extension that automated my prospecting flow**.

### What it did:

- Scanned new projects on Codeur
- Filtered by budget, tags, or project quality
- Auto-generated personalized proposals with my tone & style

It worked. I used it for **a full year**, quietly, every day.

## Breaking point

Late 2024 was rough professionally.

I lost a long-term client in Web3 after **two security breaches** (thatâ€™s a story for another time).  
Then in January, another client straight-up **refused to pay**.

> I had worked like crazy all yearâ€¦ for what?

Meanwhile, my engineering friends had stable jobs, decent salaries, and no surprise invoices.  
I realized: I needed to stop relying on **unpredictable acquisition channels**.

That internal tool, the one I built for Codeur, deserved better.  
So I decided to turn it into a real product.

## Building SupaCodeur (as a SaaS)

By January 2025, I was in my element: building MVPs.

I used my favorite stack:

- [**Nuxt**](https://nuxt.com) + [**Nuxt UI Pro**](https://ui.nuxt.com) (seriously underrated templates)
- [**Vue**](https://vuejs.org/) for the extension
- [**Supabase**](https://supabase.com/) for auth, DB, and storage
- [**Vercel**](https://vercel.com) for fast shipping
- [**GitHub**](https://github.com) to keep it clean

In **February**, the MVP was ready. Not perfect, but usable.

### The First iteration

I hosted it under [`supadev.fr`](https://supadev.fr), my studio brand.  
At first it was just:

- A simple form
- Some backend API logic
- A waiting list & filters for targeting freelancers' ideal project types
- A Chrome extension that was a bit buggy

It felt good. Clean. Lightweight.

## Getting the first user

Then came **sales**.

The great thing about SupaCodeur is that the **target market is super niche**, freelancers on Codeur.com. And the data is public:

- Phone numbers
- Names
- Project history

So I went guerrilla-style:

- Set up a **WhatsApp Business** account
- Wrote a very **aggressive sales message**
- Manually contacted 100 freelancers

> WhatsApp banned me fast. ðŸ˜‚  
> But it worked.

**Multiple people replied. I learned and eventually convert one client.**  
Thatâ€™s all I needed.

He became my first user, and a key tester.

Together, we:

- Debugged the Chrome extension
- Improved the user flow
- Identified the real pain points (and ignored the fake ones)

## Leveling up

With momentum building, I invested more:

- Bought a **dedicated domain** with a better name
- Added a real **dashboard**
- Built a nicer **stats interface**
- Refined the extension UI/UX
- Identified the different personas (freelancers, agencies, etc.)
- Create **subscriptions** for each persona

Then came **sales round #2**.

A new agency showed interest. They tested it in April.

I was excited. MRR was picking up. But not for too long...

Unfortunately, the results werenâ€™t great, low conversion on their end, the generated proposals were too generic.

But thatâ€™s part of the journey. Every new user is a **lesson**.

And we are working on it together to improve the product and give them a reason to come back.

## Long-Term play

To support the project long-term, I also:

- Launched an SEO-focused [blog](https://www.supacodeur.fr/blog)
- Launched on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/supacodeur) for backlinks
- Wrote use-case pages to boost organic discovery
- Started documenting the product more seriously

## Whatâ€™s next?

- **More users**: Iâ€™m still reaching out to freelancers and agencies, I am planning to semi automate the process.
- **More features**: Iâ€™m working on a new version of the product, with a better UI and more features.
- **More content**: Iâ€™m writing more blog posts, tutorials, and guides to help users get the most out of SupaCodeur.
- **More partnerships**: Iâ€™m looking for collaborations with other freelancers and agencies to expand the reach of SupaCodeur.
- **More feedback**: Iâ€™m actively seeking feedback from users to improve the product and make it more valuable.
- **More fun**: Iâ€™m enjoying the process of building and learning, and I want to keep it that way.

## What I Learned

- Build for yourself first. Youâ€™ll always be your best user.
- Niche SaaS markets can be super powerful if the pain is real.
- Early users are not clients â€” theyâ€™re **co-builders**.
- Guerrilla sales works when your prospect is clear and reachable.
- MVPs donâ€™t need to be polished. They need to be **used**.

SupaCodeur is still growing. Still niche. Still learning.

But now itâ€™s a real product â€” with users, feedback, and a future.

And Iâ€™m excited to share the next steps, as always, in public.
