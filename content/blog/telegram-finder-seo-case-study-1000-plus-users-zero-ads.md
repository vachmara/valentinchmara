- [**Reality check:** a **3-week product issue** killed momentum; we chose **not to rush** a bandaid even though we had a quick fix.](#why-the-downturn)
- [**Back on track:** focus now = reliability, onboarding → paid, and a browser extension.](#whats-next)

## The spark: a real founder pain

I’m Valentin, an entrepreneur from France. The idea didn’t start with me—it came from **Alexis**, my cofounder and a Web3 CEO. In his world, Telegram is where deals happen, yet finding a **real username** is painful.

He brought the problem; I brought the time. I locked in for **three days**, shipped an MVP, and went live in **March 2025**.

---

## Distribution: SEO or nothing

From day one, we bet on **organic**.

- **Exact-match domain:** [`telegram-finder.io`](telegram-finder.io) mirrors the primary query.  
- **On-page built for humans & crawlers:** H1, meta, FAQ, pricing.  
- **Lean & fast:** index quickly, reduce bounce, get users to value fast.

We also created **intent pages** to match real jobs-to-be-done:

- [Telegram Identity Finder](https://www.telegram-finder.io/telegram-identity-finder)
- [Telegram OSINT Tool](https://www.telegram-finder.io/telegram-osint-tool)
- [Telegram from Email](https://www.telegram-finder.io/telegram-from-email)
- [Telegram from LinkedIn](https://www.telegram-finder.io/linkedin-to-telegram)
- [Telegram from Phone](https://www.telegram-finder.io/telegram-from-phone-number)
- [Telegram for Web3 Sales](https://www.telegram-finder.io/telegram-for-web3-sales)

Directory listings and launches (Product Hunt, Uneed) helped reputation and links, but **search intent** brought users ready to try **now**.

## The curve: clicks, impressions, and a dip

![Search Console growth — clicks 8.59k, impressions 41.2k, CTR 20.8%, avg position 5.4](/08-27-2025-search-console.png)

**What you see above:**
- **8.59k clicks** and **41.2k impressions** to date.  
- **CTR ~20.8%** with **avg position 5.4**.  
- A strong ramp from late June → mid-August.  
- A notable **downturn** at the end of the period.

### Why the downturn?

For **three weeks**, we had a **product problem** that degraded the experience. Even though I had a quick solution in mind, I **chose not to rush it**. We paused growth experiments, diagnosed properly, and fixed the root cause. It cost us momentum—but it protects **trust, stability, and future SEO** (users bouncing on broken flows hurt rankings more than a temporary slowdown).

**What we learned:**
- Fix **activation reliability** before adding features.  
- Temporary dips are survivable; **trust debt** isn’t.  
- Communicate transparently with users during incidents.  
- Build **alerts/guardrails** so you catch regressions early.

## Product experience: 60 seconds to “aha”

- User searches **"telegram finder"**, **"telegram user search"** or **"telegram id search"**. 
- Lands on our main page where the product is front and center.  
- **20% convert to signup** with one-click Google authentication.
- Within **60 seconds**, they're searching for Telegram usernames with their free searches.
- **Instant usefulness** is what compounds—no waiting, no complex onboarding.

---

## Results so far

- **~1,300 users** on pure organic.  
- **Daily signups:** 2–3/day → **10–20/day** post-activation fix → **20–40/day** at peak before the incident.  
- **€0 ads.** Just SEO, intent coverage, backlinks, and a fast UX.
- **$70 MRR** thanks to API usage and premium plans.

---

## What’s next

- **Free → paid:** lifecycle emails and in-product nudges that surface premium value earlier.  
- **Reliability first:** better monitoring, incident playbooks, and guardrails.  
- **B2C focus:** SEO brings many individuals; we’ll keep the tool **useful in seconds** for everyone (not just sales/recruiters).

---

## Lessons for other indie builders

- Pick **one channel** and go deep. Ours is SEO.  
- Measure and fix **activation** relentlessly.  
- **Don’t trade trust for tempo.** A thoughtful fix beats a rushed patch.  
- Ship small, fast, and keep the copy crystal-clear.
