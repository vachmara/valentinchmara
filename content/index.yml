    - title: Pricing & Timelines
      questions:
        - label: How much does a project typically cost?
          content: |
            Project costs vary based on scope, complexity, features, and timeline. I offer a range of pricing options, including hourly rates and fixed-price contracts. For a more accurate estimate, please reach out with your project details.
        - label: What are your payment terms?
          content: |
            I generally require a 50% deposit to schedule the project and begin work, with the remaining 50% due upon successful project completion and delivery. I accept payments via bank transfer, cryptocurrency, and PayPal. For larger projects, I can offer flexible payment plans.
        - label: How long does a typical project take?
          content: |
            Timelines depend heavily on the project's scope and complexity. Smaller projects might take 1-2 weeks, while larger, more involved projects can range from 2 to 4 months. I always provide a detailed timeline estimate after the initial discovery phase.
        - label: Do you offer retainers or ongoing support?
          content: |
            Yes, for clients needing ongoing design support, feature development, or maintenance, I offer monthly retainer options tailored to specific needs. Let's discuss if this is something you're interested in.
    - title: About Me
      questions:
        - label: What do you enjoy most about your work?
          content: |
            I love the challenge of solving complex problems through design and technology. It's incredibly rewarding to see people interact with something I've created and find it genuinely useful and easy to navigate. Bridging the gap between user needs and technical possibilities is what truly excites me.
        - label: What are your hobbies outside of work?
          content: |
            When I'm not coding or building a SaaS, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, playing video games, and exploring new technologies. I also love to travel and experience different cultures. Additionally, I like to stay active by hiking and montainering. And of course, I love to give back to the community, so I'm trying to contribute to open-source projects as much as possible!
