  Hi, I'm **Valentin Chmara**, a full-stack web developer and solopreneur from France. I've dedicated my life to making software my passion, but it all started with my curiosity as a **mechatronic engineer**. My deep interest in technology led me through various projects in **robotics**, **cybersecurity**, and **AI** before I fully embraced the world of web development.
  <br/><br/>
  My journey into programming began with the [**Root-Me**](https://www.root-me.org/vachmara?lang=en) community when I was in high school, where I discovered the joy of solving technical challenges through Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. During my engineering studies, I worked on several exciting robotics projects that taught me how hardware and software intersect to create real-world solutions.
  <br/><br/>
  I wasnâ€™t satisfied with just surface-level knowledge in AI and deep learning, so I took things further by following the [**MIT Deep Learning**](https://introtodeeplearning.com/) course online, a resource I still highly recommend.
  <br/><br/>
  Over the years, I transitioned from tinkering with tech to building digital products used by real businesses. I founded my own studio, [**Supadev**](https://supadev.fr/en), where I help companies design and build user-focused web applications using tools like **Nuxt**, **Vue**, **Supabase**, and **TypeScript**.

  ### My approach

  My philosophy is to **solve real problems with minimal friction**. I believe that technology should serve clarity, not complexity, and that fast iterations, honest feedback, and sharp UI make all the difference. Whether it's launching a SaaS MVP or creating internal tools that save teams hours a week, I care deeply about delivering value. I favor autonomy, clean interfaces, and purposeful features. I'm especially proud when my work helps small businesses punch above their weight thanks to better tools.

  ### What keeps me going

  I'm passionate about **technology**, **entrepreneurship**, **automation**, and **software that works**, not just in theory, but in the wild. I'm constantly experimenting with side projects, from AI-powered platforms to lightweight SaaS solutions. I enjoy wearing many hats and learning by shipping.

  ### What I'm Building

  I'm passionate about building products that solve real, tangible problems. I have a strong instinct for spotting inefficiencies or market gaps, then designing tools that bring clarity and value to users.

  Here are some of my recent projects:

  - [**SupaCodeur**](https://www.supacodeur.fr) - An automation tool designed for freelancers and agencies. It helps streamline prospecting on Codeur.com, saving time and boosting conversion rates.
  - [**Telegram Finder**](https://www.telegramfinder.io) - A lead enrichment tool that helps you find Telegram usernames from LinkedIn profiles, emails, or phone numbers, ideal for outreach and growth hacking.

  I'm also a fan of open source. Just for fun, I built [**Economise**](https://github.com/vachmara/economise) in two days, a quirky recipe generator that suggests meals based on the ingredients you have at home.
  <br/><br/>
  Beyond my own tools, I actively contribute to projects I admire like **Nuxt**, **Supabase**, **Cal.com**, and more. Sharing knowledge and improving the tools I use daily is something I truly care about.

  ### Off the Grid

  Outside of coding, you'll find me exploring hiking trails, backpacking internationally, or working on my surf takeoff (still a work in progress). I also love creating tiny digital experiments just for fun.

  Thanks for stopping by. You can check out some of my [projects](https://supadev.fr/en/projects) or [connect with me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valentin-chmara/) if you have something in mind!
